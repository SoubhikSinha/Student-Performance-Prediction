>> Say 'src' is a packages. To make find_packages() know that it is a package, just add __init__.py
>> file in the package folder (This applies to all the package folders inside the project's directory)
>> Then, after finding the package, the function will try to build the package.
>> (Recall the way we install numpy, pandas, etc. - any python library)

>> Here, the project itself is considered as a package, thus the entire project development

>> If we even try to make another folder inside this 'src' folder, that internal folder
