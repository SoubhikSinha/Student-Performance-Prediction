<b>About the Project</b>
---
This project predicts a student's **Math Score** based on the following inputs:

-   **Gender**
-   **Race/Ethnicity**
-   **Parental Level of Education**
-   **Lunch Type** (e.g., free/reduced or standard)
-   **Test Preparation Course** (completed or not)
-   **Writing Score** (out of 100)
-   **Reading Score** (out of 100)

<br>
<br>

<b>Purpose</b>
---
The primary objective of building this project is to understand the structure and workflow of a machine learning project, particularly in a manner that resembles **industry-level practices**. This includes organizing components such as :

-   **Artifacts** : To store model files, datasets, and results.
-   **Logs** : To track the progress and performance of the model during development and deployment.
-   **Source Code (src)** : For implementing the logic, including data preprocessing, model training, and prediction.

<br>
<br>

<b>Key Features</b>
---
-   Predicts a student's performance in Mathematics based on multiple input factors.
-   Demonstrates the deployment of a machine learning model using Flask for a simple, user-friendly web application.
-   Offers insights into integrating various project components like logging, modular code structure, and prediction models.

<br>
<br>

<b>How to Use</b>
---
1.  Input the required fields in the web application.
2.  Click "Predict your Maths Score."
3.  The predicted score will be displayed on the screen.

<br>
<br>

<b>Motivation</b>
---
This project serves as an educational tool for beginners and developers aiming to :

-   Learn how to build, structure, and deploy a machine learning project.
-   Understand the process of integrating frontend and backend components in real-world applications.
-   Gain experience with Flask, logging, and ML pipeline organization.
