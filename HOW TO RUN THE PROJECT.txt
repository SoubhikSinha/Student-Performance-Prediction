HOW TO RUN THE PROJECT ðŸ”½
======================

1. Crate the conda virtual environment : conda create -p venv python==3.11 -y

2. Activate the conda environment : conda activate venv/

3. If you try to install the required libraries mentioned in "requirements.txt", First uncomment the "-e .", then run the command : pip install -r requirements.txt
The reason to include "-e ." is that - it will trigger the "setup.py" to create the project package (Thus, this needs to be done only once. After the above is done, comment "-e .")

4. To run the `.src\logger.py` file, first uncomment the below code, that is mentioned at the bottom of the file ðŸ”½

# Just testing the "logger.py" file
if __name__ == "__main__":
    logging.info("Loging has Started")

Then run the command : python .\src\logger.py ==> This command will create a log file, that can be found in logs folder / directory


5.  To run the `.src\exception.py' file to text exception handling, first uncomment the below code ðŸ”½

# Just testing the "exception.py" file
if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        a = 1/0
    except Exception as e:
        logging.info("Divide by Zero")
        raise CustomException(e, sys)

Then run the command : python .src\exception.py ==> This command will create a log file (and also display the exception on CLI), that can be found in logs folder / directory
