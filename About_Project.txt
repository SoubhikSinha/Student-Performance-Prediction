游리Why we created the ".gitignore" file ? 游댷
-- At times, when committing, we do not want to commit some particular files into the repository.
This file keeps the info. of those files that are not to be committed into the repo.


游리Why do we need "setup.py" file ? 游댷
-- The implementation of this python file will help others (and even me) to create the entire ML application
as a package (just like the libraries - Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn, etc.) and can also be deployed, say on Pypi !!!
Then (say) from there anyone can install the package and use it.

In Pypi, to install numpy, we have the command游댵
>> pip install numpy

Like that way others can also install the our ML Project as a package and can use its functionality
(Just like the way we use of other packages / pyhon libraries)


游리requirements.txt 游댷
-- It contains all the python libraries / package names used to implement the project.


游리If we run the below command游댵
>> pip install -r requirements.txt
-- You will see all the mentioned packages are getting installed and also (if we have mentioned '-e .')
the setup.py file will also run to build and install our project package (datascienceproject)


游리If in the project directory, if you see the file ==> <package_name>.egg-info (like alooBonda.egg-info)
-- This means that package (the project) is getting installed.
